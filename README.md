## What it's for
This is for patched Mariko or Erista systems. Basically meaning you require a mod chip to homebrew.

## What it does
Causes your system to gracefully reboot. No more holding your precious power button and wearing it down. 


## Why it's here
This was made to look exactly like the original reboot_to_payload.nro that comes with Atmosphere-NX.

It was made to satisfy my OCD cause I like the look of the original, and didn't want to use anything else. I'm stubborn. It's meant to replace Atmosphere-NX's reboot_to_payload.nro since that seems to only work on unpatched systems anyway, but it should look the same.
