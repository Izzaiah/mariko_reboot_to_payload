## What it's for.
This is for Mariko (patched) systems. It won't work on Erista (un-patched) systems.

## What it does?
Causes your system to reboot. No more holding the power button to go back to hekate or whatever payload you have.


## Why it's here?
This was made to look exactly like the original reboot_to_payload.nro that comes with Atmosphere-NX.

It was made to satisfy my OCD cause I like the look of the original, and didn't want to use anything else, as I didn't like how others I found worked and / or looked. It's meant to replace Atmosphere-NX's reboot_to_payload.nro since that doesn't work with mariko systems anyway, but it should look the same.

## The Files
I have the nro and an nsp forwarder for those that want that.
